## 💡 **Interview Talking Points**

### **"Tell me about this project"**
> "I built EduPredict AI to solve a real problem: academic institutions have diverse data formats, making analysis time-consuming. I engineered a system that uses Google Gemini LLM to automatically understand any CSV structure, achieving 95% accuracy in column detection. The platform reduced preprocessing time by 80% through intelligent imputation and can forecast enrollment trends across 100+ metric combinations in under 3 seconds per series."

### **"What was your biggest technical challenge?"**
> "Handling diverse CSV structures. Some datasets had years as columns, others as rows. I solved this by implementing a two-layer approach: first, an LLM-based semantic mapper that understands context (not just keywords), and second, intelligent clustering that automatically detects years, bins numeric data, and groups categories. This made the system truly universal."

### **"How did you measure success?"**
> "Three key metrics: (1) Schema detection accuracy - 95%+ across 8 different academic datasets, (2) Performance - 80% reduction in preprocessing time from 30 minutes to under 5 seconds, and (3) Scalability - successfully forecasting 100+ metric-dimension combinations with <3 second inference per time series."

### **"What would you improve?"**
> "I'd add three enhancements: (1) Support for LSTM/Prophet for complex seasonal patterns, (2) Real-time streaming data ingestion, and (3) Collaborative features with role-based access control. I'd also implement A/B testing to compare ARIMA vs Prophet performance across different data patterns."
